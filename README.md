# Hatch

## Overview

Hatch is a card game where you manage dragons from the egg to the battlefield to build the strongest dragon dynasty. Each dragon has a unique value, summed together, they form the value of your dynasty. The first player to reach 200 points triggers the end of game, and the player with the most points wins.

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck of cards
2. Distribute 5 cards to each player
3. Place the rest of the deck face down within reach of all players as the drawing deck
4. Select a starting player

## Taking turns

1. Refill your hand up to 5 cards
2. Discard any mercenary dragon you contracted
3. Perform any internal action, as many times as you want, in any order you want
4. You can perform an attack, involving as many hatched dragons as you wish
5. Perform any internal action, as many times as you want, in any order you want

## Internal actions

Internal actions relates to actions within your territory

### Laying an egg

You can place any card from your hand face down to indicate it's been played as an egg. The top left section of the card indicate the resources necessary for the egg to hatch. Until you have placed enough resources on the card, the egg will not be able to hatch.

### Nurturing an egg

You can place any card from your hand face up under an egg to indicate it's being used as a resource. Make sure to keep the resource icon at the bottom of the card visible for you and other players. Make sure to provide the proper resource to your egg, as a malnourished egg will not hatch properly. You may look at your egg's requriements whenever you want.

### Hatching an egg

You can turn any egg face up to make it hatch. If the exact resources required for hatching are attached to the egg, the resources are consumed and the dragon is now on the board ready to attack, and the resources used are sent to the discard pile. If the resources didn't match exactly, eg. not the right resources, too many, or not enough, both resources and dragon are sent to the discard pile.

Everytime you hatch an egg, count your dynasty's value. If you hit 200, the end of game is triggered.

#### Sacrifice

Some eggs require a dragon sacrifice to hatch. The sacrifice cost is indicated with a blood droplet icon at the top left of the card, along with the other basic resources cost. To hatch those eggs, one or more of your dragons must be sacrifed and sent to the discard pile. The blood droplet icon(s) below the dragon's value indicate their sacrifice value. Similarly to basic resources, the exact amount of sacrifice is necessary for a dragon to hatch safely, not too many sacrifices, not too little.

## Attack

An attack is the only action you can perform against an other player. It is also the only action that can be performed only once per turn. However, an attack can involve as many of your dragons as you wish.

1. Select a player as a target
2. Select the dragons from your side you wish to involve in the attack

Once sent, it is up to the defending player to organize their defense appropriately.

### Defense

Each attacking dragon entering your territory will loot your land if not blocked. Only a dragon with a higher value than the attacker can be used to block that specific attacker. Only one dragon can be used as blocker per attacker, you cannot team up. As a defender, you can either involve your own dragons, or mercenary dragons to block each attacking dragon. Mercenary dragons are dragons played directly from your hand, face up, but sideways, to indicate their contracted origin. They do not count towards your dynasty victory points pool, but they can defend like any of your own dragons. Once your turn begins, those contracted mercenaries go to the discard pile.

Defense is optional, but not defending gives an advantage to the attacker. Moreover, dragons do not die from combat, on either side.

1. Contract as many mercenaries as desired, but each mercenary MUST be involved in blocking. You cannot contract extraneous mercenaries or mercenaries too weak to block.
2. Place your dragons, hatched or contracted alike in front of each attacker they will block, one maximum per attacker. You do not need to involve all your hatched dragons, but you MUST involve all the contracted ones. Only a dragon with a higher value than the attacker can block it. 

If all attackers were blocked succesfully, it is the end of the attack, and the attackers return to their territory empty handed. Otherwise, loot happens.

### Loot

For EACH attacker that was not blocked you can choose one of the following action:

- Steal one egg of your choice, along with all the resources attached to it. The egg and the resources are now on your territory and are yours for all intents and purposes. You may look at the egg card.
- Draw 3 cards, add them to your hand, then discard 2 cards. Those 2 cards do not need to be the ones you just drew.

After the attack, you can still perform as many internal actions as you wish, especially if you acquired new eggs and/or cards.

## End of game

As soon as a player hatched an egg that brought their dynasty's value to 200 or higher, the end of game is triggered. The game doesn't end yet though. The player who triggered the end of game can continue their turn and try to increase the value of their dynasty even more. Additionally, other players do have a turn until it reaches the starting player, so that every player has had the exact same amount of turns.

## Victory

Once the end of game was triggered and all players have had the same amount of turns in the game, the player with the highest dynasty value wins the game. In case of tie, The player who triggered the end of game wins, even if they have a lower dynasty value.
