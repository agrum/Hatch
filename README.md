## Hatch

# Overview

Hatch is a card game where you manage dragons from the egg to the battlefield to create the strongest empire. Each dragon contributes to the power of your empire. The first player to reach 200 power triggers the last round. At the end of it, the player with the most power wins.

# Setup

1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Distribute five cards to each player, they can look at their own hand.
3. Place the rest of the deck face down, within reach of all players, as the drawing deck.
4. Select a starting player, that player discard one card of their choice from their hand.

# Taking turns

1. Perform any number of actions in any order you want, some actions can be repeated.
2. Refill your hand up to five cards.

You cannot play cards from your hand outside of your turn.

# Repeatable actions

Repeatable actions can be performed as often as you wish during your turn, and can be interjected by other actions.

## Laying an egg

You can place any card from your hand face up on the first row of your board to indicate it's been played as an egg. The top left section of the card indicates the resources necessary for the egg to hatch. Until you have placed enough resources on the card, the egg will not be able to hatch. Additionally, you cannot hatch an egg that was laid this turn.

## Nurturing an egg

You can place any card from your hand face up, up side down, on one of your eggs to indicate it's being used as a resource to help the egg hatch. The icon at the bottom of the card is the resource provided to the egg. You cannot nurture your egg with a resource it doesn't need.

### Basic resources

Most eggs require basic resources to hatch, those resources are:
- Food
- Fire
- Love

### Sacrifice

Some eggs require hatched dragons to be sacrificed in order to hatch. The sacrifice cost is indicated with one or multiple skull icons at the top left section of the card, along with the other basic resource costs. Each dragon has a specific sacrifice value, visible at the bottom right of the card. Some dragons are only worth one sacrifice, some are worth much more and some do not have a sacrifice value. A dragon with no sacrifice value cannot be sacrificed. 

Only your hatched dragons can be used as sacrifices, you cannot sacrifice a mercenary. When sacrificing a dragon, its sacrifice value can be spread over multiple eggs to help them hatch. Sacrifices must be used on the turn they were done, they do not carry over to the next turn.

Three eggs, resources and/or cards in hand can be discarded to provide one sacrifice's worth.

### Wild resource

Some eggs have a more flexible resource requirement, indicated with a ⭘ icon in top left section of the card. It indicates any basic resource can be used: food, fire, love or wild; but not a sacrifice.

Inversely, some cards provide an all nurturing basic resource, indicated with a ☆ icon in the bottom center section of the card. It indicates it can be used to meet the requirement of any resource for an egg, food, fire, love or wild; but not a sacrifice. You can wait until hatch time to decide what resource the wild one will be used as. 

## Hatching an egg

Move an egg to the second row of your board to signify it is hatching. You can only hatch an egg which has its resource needs met, and that wasn't laid this turn. Discard all resources that were placed on the egg. The resources used are sent to the discard pile; the sacrificed dragons as well. 
If for any reason the resources don't match exactly, e.g., not the right resources, too many, or not enough, both resources and egg are sent to the discard pile.

Every time you hatch an egg, count your empire's power. If you hit 200, the end of the game is triggered.

## Contracting a mercenary

A card can be placed face down, sideways, on the second row. It indicates you have a single use mercenary dragon at the ready. A face down mercenary can remain on your board multiple turns, until you reveal it. You may reveal it whenever you see fit to perform an action or defend. A face up mercenary has the same capabilities as any of your hatched dragon. However, mercenaries do not count towards your empire power. Additionally, you must discard any face up mercenary after the action they were revealed for. You may only have one mercenary on your board at a time, face up or down. You may discard an unused mercenary.

# Non-repeatable actions

Non-repeatable actions are either attacks or rituals. You may only perform one attack OR ritual per turn. Similarly to repeatable actions, you may perform your non-repeatable action after or before any of the other actions during your turn.

## Ritual

You may use two of your hatched dragons and/or mercenaries to perform a ritual if they share the same resource symbol at the bottom of the card:

* Food: Reduces the resource requirement of one of your egg by one basic resource of our choice, only lasts until the end of turn
* Love: Draw a card from the deck and place it as an egg on your board
* Fire: Destroy a card, resource or egg with no resources on it from an opponent that has not been targeted yet during their off-turn

You may involve one additional hatched dragon and/or mercenary with a wild resource to repeat the ritual you just performed with the same or a new target.

## Attack

1. Select a player that has not been targeted yet during their off-turn yet.
2. You may reveal your mercenary to add its power to your empire's power for the purpsoe of the attack.
3. The defending player may reveal their mercenary to add to their empire's power for the purpsoe of the defense.
4. The player with the highest power wins the encounter. If the defense wins or ties, nothing happens, the revealed mercenaries are discarded. If the offense wins, they may either:
  1. Bring one egg with no resource card on it from the defender's board to their board, they may hatch it as one of their own once they meet the resource requirements.
  2. Steal one resource on display on one of the defender's eggs and place it on one of their eggs.
  3. Steal one card at random from the defender's hand and place it in their hand.

# End of game

As soon as a player hatches an egg that brings their empire's power to 200 or higher, the end of the game is triggered. From then on, every card on every player's board also contributes to 5 power for their empire, including eggs, resources and face down mercenaries, but not cards in hand.

The game doesn't end yet, though. The player who triggered the end of the game can continue their turn and try to increase the value of their empire even more. Additionally, other players also get one final turn until it reaches the starting player, so every player has had the exact same amount of turns.

# Victory

Once the end of the game was triggered and all players have had the same amount of turns in the game, the player with the highest empire power wins the game. In a tie, the player who triggered the end of game wins, even if they have a lower dynasty value.
