## Hatch

# Overview

Hatch is a card game where you manage dragons from the egg to the battlefield to build the strongest dragon dynasty. Each dragon has a unique value; summed together, they form the value of your dynasty. The first player to reach 200 points triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most points wins.

# Internal actions

Internal actions relate to actions within your territory.

## Laying an egg

You can place any card from your hand face down to indicate it's been played as an egg. The top left section of the card indicates the resources necessary for the egg to hatch. Until you have placed enough resources on the card, the egg will not be able to hatch. 

## Nurturing an egg

You can place any card from your hand face up on one of your eggs to indicate it's being used as a resource to help the egg hatch. The icon at the bottom of the card is the resource provided to the egg. Make sure to provide the proper resources for your egg, as a malnourished egg will not hatch properly. You may look at your egg's requirements whenever you want.

### Basic resources

Most eggs require basic resources to hatch, those resources are:
- Food
- Heat
- Love

### Sacrifice

Some eggs require hatched dragons to be sacrificed in order to hatch. The sacrifice cost is indicated with a blood droplet icon at the top left section of the card, along with the other basic resource costs. Each dragon has a specific sacrifice value, visible at the bottom right of the card. Some dragons are only worth 1 sacrifice, while some can be worth up to 5. End game dragons have no sacrifice value and cannot be sacrificed.

Only your hatched dragons can be used as sacrifices.

### Wild resource

Some eggs have a more flexible resource requirement, indicated with a ☆ icon in top left section of the card. It indicates any basic resource can be used, food, heat, love or wild; but not a sacrifice.

Inversely, some cards provide an all nurturing basic resource, indicated with a ☆ icon in the bottom center section of the card. It indicates it can be used to meet the requirement of any resource for an egg, square, triangle, circle or wild; but not a sacrifice. 

## Hatching an egg

You can turn any egg face up to make it hatch. If the exact resources required for hatching are attached to the egg, the resources are consumed, and the dragon is now on your territory, ready to attack. The resources used are sent to the discard pile, even the sacrifices. If the resources don't match exactly, e.g., not the right resources, too many, or not enough, both resources and dragon are sent to the discard pile.

Every time you hatch an egg, count your dynasty's value. If you hit 200, the end of the game is triggered.

## Contracting a mercenary

A card can be placed face down, sideways, besides your hatched dragons. It can be flipped face up as a dragon when defending to bolster your army temporarily. When your turn begins, a face up mercenary must be discarded. Keep your mercenary card sideways to distinguish between your hatched dragons and the mercenary. A face down mercenary remains on your territory when your turn begins. Mercenaries do not count towards your dynasty value. You can only have a single mercenary at a time. You may discard your face down mercenary to replace it with an other one from your hand. Mercenaries cannot be used to attack.

# Attack

An attack is the only action you can perform against another player. It is also the only action that can be performed only once per turn. However, an attack can involve as many of your dragons as you wish.

1. Select a player as a target.
2. Select the hatched dragons from your side you wish to involve in the attack.

Once sent, it is up to the defending player to organize their defence appropriately.

You cannot attack a player who hasn't had a turn yet.

## Defence

Attacking dragons entering your territory will loot your land if they are not blocked. One of your dragons can block at most a single attacking dragon. Multiple of your dragons can block the same attacking dragon. Place your defending dragons in front of the attacking dragon you they will block. If the summed value of the defending dragons is higher than the attacker's, the block is succesful. As a defender, you can involve your own dragons and your contarcted mercenary dragon to block the attack.

Defence is optional, but not defending gives an advantage to the attacker. Moreover, dragons on either side do not die from combat.

If all attackers were blocked successfully, it is now the end of the attack, and the attackers return to their territory empty-handed. Otherwise, looting happens.

## Looting

If at least one attacker was not blocked, the attacking player can choose one of the following actions:

- Destroy one egg of your choice from the defender's territory, along with all the resources attached to it. The egg and the resources are discarded.
- Draw one card from the top of drawing deck or discard deck.

After the attack, you can still perform as many internal actions as you wish, which might come in handy if you acquired new cards.

# End of game

As soon as a player hatches an egg that brings their dynasty's value to 200 or higher, the end of the game is triggered. The game doesn't end yet, though. The player who triggered the end of the game can continue their turn and try to increase the value of their dynasty even more. Additionally, other players do have a turn until it reaches the starting player, so every player has had the exact same amount of turns.

# Victory

Once the end of the game was triggered and all players have had the same amount of turns in the game, the player with the highest dynasty value wins the game. In a tie, the player who triggered the end of game wins, even if they have a lower dynasty value.
